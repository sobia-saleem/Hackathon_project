## Statistics New Zealand (StatsNZ)

Statistics NZ have 27 repositories on Github (albeit several empty ones). There appears to be three general themes to their repositories:

1.  Publish code which links to available resources on their main website. E.g. They have utilised Github to publish code which was used to generate their software data portal (see [StatsNz](https://www.stats.govt.nz/experimental/covid-19-data-portal)).
2.  House code for functions they have developed to assist in their analysis or visualisation (usually in R).
3.  Share code they have used for data analysis on Statistics NZ data sets. In this case they only upload data if there is agreement from stakeholders. Otherwise they just include the methods and flag in the 'ReadMe' file that the data is partially available or unavailable.

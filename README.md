### Statistics New Zealand (StatsNZ)
https://github.com/StatisticsNZ

#### How are statistical or ML research organisations using public GitHub repositories?
* :coffee: create R pakckages for multiple purposes and for each project there are multiple contributors
    - each repository is a package which contains: a series of R scripts/functions in a folder; toy datasets; a showcase bio etc...
* :tea: store html files which are used in iframe on their website
    - e.g. The iteractive figure (iframe) in https://www.stats.govt.nz/experimental/covid-19-data-portal used the html files in [data_portal](https://github.com/StatisticsNZ/data_portal)
    
#### Are there guidelines for how GitHub is used by these organisations?
Pretty much everything StatsNZ posted on GitHub are covered by:
* :crown: Crown Copyright(c), Statistics New Zealand on behalf of the New Zealand Government
In addition, if those are R.packages, they are also under:
* :school: MIT License
* :rocket: [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
